        <h1>Overcoming Addictions</h1>
        <h3>Types of Technology Addiction</h3>
        <h4>Cybersex Addiction</h4>
        <p>A cybersex addiction is one of the more self-explanatory internet addictions. It involves
            online pornography, adult
            websites, sexual fantasy/adult chat rooms, and XXX webcam services. An obsession with
            any of these services can be
            harmful to one’s ability to form real-world sexual, romantic, or intimate relationships.
        </p>

        <h4>Net Compulsions</h4>
        <p>Net compulsions concern interactive activities online that can be extremely harmful, such
            as online gambling, trading
            stocks, online auctions (such as eBay), and compulsive online shopping. These habits can
            have a detrimental impact
            on one’s financial stability and disrupt job-related duties. Spending or losing
            excessive amounts of money can also
            cause
            stress in one’s relationships. With instant and easy access to online casinos and
            stores, it is easy for those who
            are
            already susceptible to a gambling or spending addiction to get hooked online.</p>

        <h4>Cyber (Online) Relationship Addiction</h4>
        <p>Cyber or online relationship addicts are deeply involved with finding and maintaining
            relationships online, often
            forgetting and neglecting real-life family and friends. Typically online relationships
            are formed in chat rooms or
            different social networking sites but can occur anywhere one can interact with people
            online. </p>

        <h4>Computer Or Gaming Addiction</h4>
        <p>Computer addiction, sometimes referred to as computer gaming addiction, involves online
            and offline activities that
            can
            be done with a computer. As computers became more widely available, games such as
            Solitaire, Tetris, and Minesweeper
            were programed into their software. Researchers quickly found that obsessive computer
            game playing was becoming a
            problem in certain settings. Office employees would spend excessive amounts of time
            playing these games, causing a
            notable decrease in productivity. Not only are these classic games still available today
            but so are thousands of new
            ones, and the condition of computer gaming addiction is as prevalent and harmful as
            ever.</p>
        <div class="effect">
            <h2>What A Technology Addiction Does to You</h2>

            <div class="health">
                <h3>To your Body</h3>
                <p>Even though using technology isn’t the same as using drugs or alcohol, the brain
                    processes both addictions the same way. Winning a level of a video game, getting
                    “likes” on a picture, and gambling online releases dopamine, a feel-good
                    chemical in the brain, just like drinking alcohol or using drugs does. Over
                    time, we begin to crave this dopamine release, which compels us to use
                    technology and internet-enabled devices even more. Unfortunately, this tricks
                    the brain into thinking it doesn’t need to create and release dopamine
                    naturally, which disrupts the brain’s delicate chemical balance.

                    Without enough dopamine, we tend to feel down, have trouble concentrating, and
                    struggle to stay motivated. Naturally, we seek another dopamine release. The
                    brain, which now identifies technology as a reliable way to release dopamine,
                    signals us to spend even more time on the internet, increasing our risk of an
                    internet addiction disorder.</p>
                <p><strong>Disrupting the brain’s ability to differentiate day from night.</strong>
                    The glowing light emitted by laptops, tablets, and smartphones tends to
                    interfere with the brain and body’s internal light cues and sleep-inducing
                    hormones. Constantly exposing ourselves to bright lights can make the brain
                    think it’s still daytime when it’s actually night. This, of course, can make
                    falling asleep difficult and can trigger disrupted sleep patterns and insomnia.

                <h3>Some Tips</h3>
                <p>In the digital world we find ourselves in total abstinence from technology is
                    unrealistic, nor is it an effective means of correction of the problem. There is
                    consensus that abstinence from digital devices should not be the goal of
                    treatment, but rather the goal should be moderation and balance. However,
                    abstinence from digital devices, or at least abstinence from the source of the
                    problem (ex: social media, gaming, porn, and other digital sources that are not
                    at the root of the individual’s addiction), may be encouraged for the initiation
                    of treatment for up to 45 to 90 days until the individual is able to work
                    towards moderation if moderation is the goal.</p>
                <p>The first step of treating a digital addiction is the individual’s awareness of
                    the problem, and a desire to want to get help. This is often the most
                    challenging step for the individual. Oftentimes the problem is realized by
                    family and friends who may seek out help on behalf of the individual. In many
                    cases an intervention is needed in order to assist the individual into
                    recognition of the problem and help them initiate treatment. If the individual
                    is motivated the issue can resolve itself with self-corrective behaviors,
                    screen-life balance, and assistance from technological innovations that help
                    with digital moderation such as by enabling app restrictions or WiFi
                    restrictions, turning off notifications, enabling “Do Not Disturb” mode, setting
                    up automatic email/text responses, enabling automatic downtime, blocking apps or
                    websites, using screen time reports, and other such innovations that can help
                    curb digital use.</p>
                <p>For those that may need to seek professional help from an addiction therapist
                    there are different modalities of treatment available for technology addictions.
                    Since each individual is unique with their own set of circumstances, history,
                    and symptoms it is important to find a treatment approach that works for each
                    respective individual, and tailor it to meet their needs. It will be important
                    to address the contributing factors that led a digital addiction such as
                    neurological imbalances, underlying mental health issues, and environmental
                    stressors.</p>
