            <h2>What An Alcohol Addiction Does to You</h2>
            <div class="body">
                <h3>To your body</h3>
                <p>Thirty seconds after your first sip, alcohol races into your brain. It slows down the chemicals and
                    pathways that your brain cells use to send messages. That alters your mood, slows your reflexes, and
                    throws off your balance. You also can’t think straight, which you may not recall later, because
                    you’ll struggle to store things in long-term memory.</p>
                <p>Your liver breaks down almost all the alcohol you drink. In the process, it handles a lot of toxins.
                    Over time, heavy drinking makes the organ fatty and lets thicker, fibrous tissue build up. That
                    limits blood flow, so liver cells don’t get what they need to survive. As they die off, the liver
                    gets scars and stops working as well, a disease called cirrhosis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You might not link a cold with a night of drinking, but there might be a connection. Alcohol puts
                    the
                    brakes on your immune system. Your body can’t make the numbers of white blood cells it needs to
                    fight
                    germs. So for 24 hours after drinking, you’re more likely to get sick. Long-term, heavy drinkers are
                    much more likely to get illnesses like pneumonia and tuberculosis.
                </p>

            <div class="family">
                <h3>To your Family</h3>
                <p>Alcohol abuse and alcoholism within a family is a problem that can destroy a marriage or drive a
                    wedge between members. That means people who drink can blow through the family budget, cause fights,
                    ignore children, and otherwise impair the health and happiness of the people they love.</p>
                <p> Alcohol can impair one’s cognitive functions and physical capabilities, and this, at some point,
                    will likely result in neglect of responsibilities associated with work, home life, and/or school.
                </p>
                <p>Drinking can increase a person’s likelihood of getting into fights, displaying disorderly conduct in
                    public, driving under the influence, and becoming involved in domestic disputes or violence. </p>

                    <h4>1. Seek Treatment</h4>
                    Attending an outpatient or inpatient rehabilitation facility can the best way to stop drinking. This
                    is primarily due to medical supervision and care. Alternatively therapy can help you self-reflect
                    and understand the reason you drink. It can also help you change your thought patterns to avoid
                    alcohol.
                </button>
                <div class="text">
                    When seeking treatment the first step is often to consult your primary care doctor or GP. Your
                    doctor can evaluate your drinking patterns, diagnose any co-occurring disorders, assess your overall
                    health, and offer treatment referrals. They may even be able to prescribe medication to help you
                    quit.

                    <h4>2. Announce your goal</h4>
                    Spending time with people who always drink can tempt you to drink again. Spending time with people
                    who don't drink helps you practice new habits.
                </button>
                <div class="text">
                    Let friends, family members, and co-workers know that you’re trying to stop or cut back on drinking.
                    If they drink, ask them to support your recovery by not doing so in front of you. Sometimes this
                    means distancing yourself from people who don’t support your efforts to stop drinking or respect the
                    limits you’ve set and may mean giving up certain friends and social connections.

                    <h4> 3.Cutting Back</h4>
                    Whether or not you can successfully cut back on your drinking depends on the severity of your
                    drinking problem. If you’re not ready to quit entirely, or if you don’t have an alcohol abuse
                    problem but want to cut back for personal or health reasons, consider the following tips
                </button>
                <div class="text">
                    Choose a limit for how much you’ll drink and write your drinking goal down and keep it where you
                    will frequently see it, such as on your phone or taped to your refrigerator. <br>Keep a record of
                    your drinking to help you reach your goal. For 3 to 4 weeks, write down every time you have a drink
                    and how much you drink. <br>When you drink, sip slowly and take a break of 30 minutes or one hour
                    between drinks. Or drink soda, water, or juice between alcoholic drinks. Drinking on an empty
                    stomach is never a good idea, so make sure you eat food when you drink.
                </div>

                <button type="button" class="collapse">
                    <h4> 4. Change Your Habits</h4>
                    Reshape your habits that were linked to drinking. For example, if you go to happy hour often, change
                    locations to a cafe.
                </button>
                <div class="text">
                    Finding ways to identify your causes for can drinking be extremely beneficial to making progress.
                    When do they occur most frequently? Do certain people or places trigger them? Do you have a negative
                    thought followed by an intense urge to drink? Identifying negative thoughts can be difficult, but it
                    helps to have someone other than yourself helping you. For some, this is a family member or support
                    person. For many, counselors and therapists are professionally-trained experts in this type of
                    healing.

                <button type="button" class="collapse">
                    <h4> 5. Support Groups</h4>
                    You can attend Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or other support group meetings. This will provide you with
                    a community of other sober friends.
                </button>
                <div class="text">
                    Finding an organization or community group where you can give back to other people is another
                    valuable tool in recovery. Serving others allows your mind to take a break from your own struggle
                    and refocus your thoughts. It can be a volunteer organization or simply helping out family members,
                    friends or peers in recovery.
