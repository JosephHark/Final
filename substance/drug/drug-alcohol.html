        <h1>Overcoming Addictions</h1>
        <div class="effect">
          <h2>Common Types Of Drugs</h2>
<p>There are a wide variety of addictive substances that exist, but the most common types are classified under 6 main categories: alcohol, Benzodiazepines, illicit drugs, Opiates, Sleeping Pills, and Stimulants.</p>
          <h3>Alcohol</h3>
            <p>Alcohol is a legal controlled substance that slows down the body’s vital functions when consumed in excess. Its many forms include beer, wine, and liquor. </p>
          <h3>Benzodiazepines</h3>
            <p>Benzodiazepines, or Benzos, include pharmaceutical drugs used to treat a wide array of mental disorders including severe anxiety and panic attacks. </p>
          <h3>Illicit Drugs</h3>
            <p>Illicit drugs include powerfully addictive and illegal substances such as Heroin and Meth. The nature of these substances can vary greatly.</p>
          <h3>Opiates</h3>
            <p>Opiates encompass prescription drugs that are used to treat acute and chronic pain. </p>
          <h3>Sleeping Pills</h3>
            <p>Sleeping Pills fall under a category of prescription medications known as sedative-hypnotics. </p>
          <h3>Stimulants</h3>
            <p>Typically, stimulants are used to treat mental disorders like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). They are generally used to enhance performance rather than to achieve a high.</p>
          
            <h2>What A Drug Addiction Does to You</h2>
            <div class="health">
                <h3>To your Health</h3>
                <p>Drugs are chemicals that affect the body and brain. Different drugs can have different effects. Some effects of drugs include health consequences that are long-lasting and permanent. They can even continue after a person has stopped taking the substance.</p>
              <p>They cause large amounts of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that helps regulate our emotions, motivation and feelings of pleasure, to flood the brain and produce a “high.” Eventually, drugs can change how the brain works and interfere with a person’s ability to make choices, leading to intense cravings and compulsive drug use. Over time, this behavior can turn into a substance dependency, or drug addiction.</p>
          
            </div>

            <div class="family">
                <h3>To your Family</h3>
                <p>The effects of drug and alcohol addiction can be both short-term and long-term. Peaceful, loving homes can be divided by the strain caused by drug and alcohol abuse. Conflict becomes normal as family members fight to engage with a child who abuses Heroin, for example. Trust begins to erode. Relatives may become more guarded if a relative abusing illicit substances acts with aggression or hides their disorder in secrecy. Marriages can end due to changes caused by addiction. Communication becomes more difficult, highlighting frustration.</p>
              <p>Family members may see their relative endure side effects of drugs or fly into rages when under the influence of alcohol. Others may see their relatives lose weight rapidly, becoming unrecognizable. Some may not hear from a loved one for an extended period of time, only to discover that they are living on the street or have fatally overdosed. Such shocks can cause a relative to endure severe trauma or develop unhealthy coping mechanisms like codependent behaviors in response.</p>
              <p>Witnessing the trauma of a parent suffering from addiction at a young age has long-term effects on the child. Children who grow up seeing a parent addicted to drugs or alcohol are more likely to develop SUDs in their adulthood. They are also 3 times more likely to be neglected or physically and/or sexually abused. Seeing a parent on drugs often invokes distressing emotions which not only create delays in learning and development but can also lead to pronged mental and emotional disorders. Since children are still developing their personalities and are vulnerable to external influences, they run the risk of repeating such behaviors.</p>

        <div class="recover">
            <h2>Recovery</h2>
            <div class="tips">
                <h3>Some Tips</h3>
                <p>For many people struggling with addiction, the toughest step toward recovery is the very first one: recognizing that you have a problem and deciding to make a change. It’s normal to feel uncertain about whether you’re ready to start recovery, or if you have what it takes to quit. If you’re addicted to a prescription drug, you may be concerned about how you’re going to find an alternate way to treat a medical condition. It’s okay to feel torn.</p>
              <p>Once you’ve committed to recovery, it’s time to explore your treatment choices. While addiction treatment can vary according to the specific drug, a successful program often includes different elements, such as:<br>

Detoxification. Usually the first step is to purge your body of drugs and manage withdrawal symptoms.<br>

Behavioral counseling. Individual, group, and/or family therapy can help you identify the root causes of your drug use, repair your relationships, and learn healthier coping skills.<br>

Medication may be used to manage withdrawal symptoms, prevent relapse, or treat any co-occurring mental health condition such as depression or anxiety.<br>

Long-term follow-up can help to prevent relapse and maintain sobriety. This may include attending regular in-person support groups or online meetings to help keep your recovery on track.</p>
